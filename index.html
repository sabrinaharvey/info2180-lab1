 <h2>Sabrina Harvey</h2>
 <p> My name is Sabrina Harvey. I am pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I have been
    interested in Web Development since I was 15 years old. I had stumbled upon a site called Codecademy
    which taught me the basics of HTML and CSS. Throughout doing the course, I was continously impressed
    by the many different things I could do using HTML and CSS. That is why I decided to take this course, 
    hoping to learn more about these languages and hopefully create some beautiful websites of my own.
